# De-Smoke  
### A Behavioral Support Application for Nicotine Cessation

---

## Abstract

De-Smoke is an Android-installable Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed to support individuals undergoing voluntary nicotine cessation. The application integrates behavioral reinforcement mechanisms, abstinence duration tracking, financial incentive modeling, craving interruption protocols, and trigger pattern analysis to assist users during withdrawal and long-term habit restructuring.

The system operates entirely offline. All data is stored locally on the user’s device. No personal data is transmitted or collected.

## 1. Clinical Background

Nicotine dependence involves:

- Dopaminergic reward pathway reinforcement  
- Conditioned habit loops  
- Emotional and environmental triggers  
- Withdrawal-related physiological and psychological symptoms  

Evidence-based cessation strategies commonly incorporate:

- Trigger identification  
- Behavioral monitoring  
- Cognitive interruption techniques  
- Milestone-based reinforcement  
- Identity restructuring  

De-Smoke digitally implements these behavioral principles in a structured, self-guided format.

## 2. Intended Use

De-Smoke is intended for:

- Adults attempting smoking cessation  
- Individuals seeking behavioral self-support tools  
- Personal nicotine abstinence tracking  

This application does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent medical conditions.

## 4. Functional Components

### 4.1 Abstinence Duration Tracker

Provides continuous real-time calculation of:

- Days
- Hours
- Minutes
- Seconds since quit initiation

Clinical Rationale:
Time-based reinforcement strengthens perceived progress and enhances abstinence commitment.

---

### 4.2 Financial Impact Visualization

Calculates:

- Daily expenditure avoided
- Total accumulated savings
- Projected annual savings

Clinical Rationale:
Financial reinforcement increases motivation by providing measurable tangible benefits.

---

### 4.3 Craving Survival Protocol (CSP)

A structured multi-stage intervention including:

1. Timed focus countdown
2. Cognitive engagement activity
3. Craving resistance confirmation

Clinical Rationale:
Interrupts impulsive behavior during peak craving windows (typically 5–10 minutes).

---

### 4.4 Craving Pattern Analysis

Logs timestamped craving events and evaluates:

- Hour-of-day frequency patterns
- Recurring high-risk periods

Clinical Rationale:
Improves anticipatory coping strategies and trigger awareness.

---

### 4.5 Emotional State Monitoring

Allows users to log mood states such as:

- Stress
- Boredom
- Anger
- Social pressure
- Calm

Contextual coping guidance is provided accordingly.

Clinical Rationale:
Emotional dysregulation is strongly correlated with relapse vulnerability.

---

### 4.6 Milestone and Identity Reinforcement System

Milestones include:

- 24 hours
- 72 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days
- 90 days

Rank progression system reinforces non-smoker identity development.

Clinical Rationale:
Identity-based behavioral change is associated with improved long-term cessation outcomes.

---

De-Smoke integrates principles derived from:

- Habit Loop Theory (Cue → Routine → Reward)
- Dopamine receptor recalibration models
- Cognitive Behavioral Intervention
- Milestone reinforcement psychology
- Identity transformation models

No pharmacological therapy is included.
